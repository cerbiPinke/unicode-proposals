Xpand 2 is a versatile and powerful software that can handle any genre or style of music. Whether you need a simple piano sound, a complex orchestral arrangement, a catchy synth lead, or a heavy guitar riff, Xpand 2 has it all. You can mix and match sounds from different categories, such as keyboards, drums, percussion, guitars, basses, strings, brass, woodwinds, vocals, ethnic instruments, and more. You can also layer up to four sounds per patch and adjust their volume, pan, tuning, and filter settings.
 
Xpand 2 also gives you full control over the sound design and editing aspects of your music. You can use the six smart knobs to tweak the most critical sound elements, such as attack, decay, sustain, release, cutoff, resonance, and more. You can also select the easy mode and control all four parts in a patch simultaneously. If you want to go deeper into the sound creation process, you can use the modulation matrix to assign various sources and destinations for modulation effects. You can also use the arpeggiator to create rhythmic patterns and melodies with different modes and rates.
 
Xpand 2 also comes with two independent effect processors that can add depth and dimension to your sounds. You can choose from fifty studio-grade effects, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, compression, EQ, and more. You can edit the effect parameters and apply them to individual parts or the entire patch. You can also use the chaos delay effect to create unpredictable and chaotic sound variations.
