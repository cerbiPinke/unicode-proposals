One of the features of Fabrication CADmep 2017 is that it can be run as a portable application from a USB drive or a cloud storage service. This means that users can access the software without installing it on their computers, saving time and disk space. However, this also comes with some drawbacks, such as reduced performance, compatibility issues, and security risks.
 
A portable torrent is a file that contains the data needed to download and run a portable application using a peer-to-peer network. This can be a convenient way to share and distribute software, but it also poses some challenges. For instance, users need to have a torrent client installed on their computers, and they need to verify the authenticity and integrity of the torrent file before downloading it. Moreover, downloading and running software from unknown sources can expose users to malware, viruses, and legal consequences.
 
Therefore, before downloading and using Fabrication CADmep 2017 Portable Torrent, users should consider the pros and cons of this option. They should also check the official website of Autodesk for more information about Fabrication CADmep 2017 and its system requirements, features, support, and pricing[^4^].

Some of the new features of Fabrication CADmep 2017 include:
 
- Improved BIM and CAD integration: Users can import and export data from Revit and AutoCAD more easily and accurately, and use shared content libraries and databases with other Fabrication products[^2^].
- Enhanced modeling tools: Users can create more complex and realistic models of MEP systems with new tools such as sloped piping, hangers, supports, and insulation[^2^].
- Streamlined fabrication workflows: Users can generate fabrication-ready drawings, reports, and NC files with improved annotation, dimensioning, and labeling options[^2^].

Fabrication CADmep 2017 also has some system requirements that users should be aware of before installing it. These include:

- Operating system: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 7 SP1 (64-bit only)[^3^]
- Processor: Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64 (3 GHz or higher)[^3^]

- Graphics card: DirectX 9.0c capable graphics card with Shader Model 3 (256 MB or higher video card memory)[^3^]

Fabrication CADmep 2017 is a powerful software that can help MEP contractors create high-quality fabrication models and drawings. However, users should also consider the advantages and disadvantages of using a portable torrent version of the software, as well as the official sources of information and support from Autodesk.
