# How to Unlock and Relock Bootloader on Sony Ericsson Devices with SE Bootloader Unlocking Relocking 1.6.62
 
If you want to install custom ROMs, kernels, mods or root your Sony Ericsson device, you will need to unlock the bootloader first. Unlocking the bootloader allows you to flash unsigned firmware and custom kernels on your device, but it also voids your warranty and may cause some issues with DRM-protected content and features. Therefore, you may want to relock the bootloader if you need to restore your device to stock firmware or send it for repair.
